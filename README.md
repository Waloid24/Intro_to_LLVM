# Intro to LLVM
Hello everybody! 

Here are the homework assignments from **Sergey Lisitsyn**'s course "Intro to LLVM" from Huawei. 

In the `llvm_instructions` folder you will find a small overview of the LLVM IR instructions and the code they are used to compile. 

The `llvm_pass` folder contains my LLVM pass.
